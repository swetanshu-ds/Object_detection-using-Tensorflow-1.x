If you want to change the images then go to -

->  models
-> research
-> object_detection
-> test_images

and inside the test images ,there are two images , change those two images with some different two images and keep the tag is image1.jpg and image2.jpg

If you want to change the model with some other model then simply type the model name from seeing the original model repository whose link is -
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/v1.13.0/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md

And then copy the model name or else copy the model link address and then cut out the model name from the link.
Then paste it in the place of MODEL_NAME.
